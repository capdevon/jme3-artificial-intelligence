This package contains a study version of NMGen.  NMGen is an adaptation
in Java of Recast's static mesh functionality for purposes of study
and experimentation.  NMGen takes an arbitrary triangle mesh as input
and generates data representing the traversable surface of the source mesh. 

Recast is a C++ navigation mesh construction toolset created by 
Mikko Mononen and released under the MIT license.
