/**
 * A class used to build solid heightfields from source geometry using a
 * given configuration. The solid heightfield represents the space obstructed
 * by the source geometry.
 * <p>Each triangle in the source geometry is voxelized using conservative
 * voxelization and added to the field. Conservative voxelization is an
 * algorithm that ensures that polygon surfaces are completely encompassed
 * by the the generated voxels.</p>
 * <p>At the end of the process, spans with the {@link SpanFlags#WALKABLE}
 * flag have survived the following tests:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The top of the span is at least a minimum distance from the bottom of
 * the span above it.  (The tallest agent can "stand" on the span without
 * colliding with an obstruction above.)</li>
 * <li>The top voxel of the span represents geometry with a slope below a
 * maximum allowed value. (The slope is low enough to be traversable by
 * agents.)</li>
 * <li>If ledge culling is enabled, the top of the span does not represent
 * a ledge.  (Agents can legally "step down" from the span to any of its
 * neighbors.)</li>
