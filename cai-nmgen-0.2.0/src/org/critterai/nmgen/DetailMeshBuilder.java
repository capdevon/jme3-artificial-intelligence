         * 
         * In the best case search: Search up the height field column
         * corresponding to  the vertices x and z-values and return the
         * span whose floor is within the  correct tolerance of the y-value.
         * 
         * While, technically, the best case search should always be
         * successful, floating point errors and other special cases can
         * result in a search failure. In such cases the search is expanded
         * to the 8-neighbor cells, resulting in a slower search.
         * 
         * If a search if forced to include neighbors, the search will
         * always be a full 8-neighbor search.  (No early exists.)
         * 
         * Known special case when this occurs:
         * 
         * The vertex lies on the outer edge of a border span. (The span
         * edge across which there is no other span, at any height.)
         * 
         * The vertex lies on the outer edge of a span without a connected
         * neighbor. (The cell across the span edge contains spans, but
         * none are connected as a neighbor to the span.)
         * 
         * The scope of these special cases may not be fully known since
         * a search failure can be hidden.  E.g. When building a height
         * patch, as long as one vertex in a polygon gets a good result,
         * the flood fill algoritm can still succeed. The search failures
         * will never be visible.  There may be other special cases
         * which are hidden in a similar manner.
         * 
         * The known special cases are much less likely to exhibit when
         * the source height field contains null (zero) region borders.
         * This is because a border forces all vertices in from the region
         * edges, which is where problems occur.
