     * @param minTraversableHeight Represents the minimum floor to ceiling
     * height that will still allow the floor area to be considered walkable.
     * <p>Permits detection of overhangs in the geometry which make the
     * geometry below become unwalkable.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  > 0</p>
     * 
     * @param maxTraversableStep Represents the maximum ledge height that
     * is considered to still be walkable.
     * <p>Prevents minor deviations in height from improperly showing as
     * obstructions. Permits detection of stair-like structures, curbs, etc.
     * </p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param traversableAreaBorderSize Represents the closest any part
     * of the navmesh can get to an obstruction in the source mesh.
     * <p>Usually set to the maximum bounding radius of entities utilizing
     * the navmesh for navigation decisions.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param smoothingThreshold The amount of smoothing to be performed
     * when generating the distance field.
     * <p>This value impacts region formation and border detection.  A higher
     * value results in generally larger regions and larger border sizes.
     * A value of zero will disable smoothing.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  0 <= value <= 4</p>
     * 
     * @param filterFlags The flags used to determine which spans from the
     * source {@link SolidHeightfield} should be used to build the
     * {@link OpenHeightfield}.  Only those spans which whose flags
     * exactly match the filter flag will be considered for inclusion in
     * the generated open field.
     * <p>Note: Spans from the source field which do not match the filter
     * flags are still taken into account as height obstructions.<p>
     * 
     * @param useConservativeExpansion Applies extra algorithms to regions
     * to help prevent poorly formed regions from forming.
     * <p>If the navigation mesh is missing sections that should be present,
     * then enabling this feature will likely fix the problem</p>
     * <p>Enabling this feature significantly increased processing cost.</p>
     * 
     * @param regionAlgorithms  A list of the algorithms to run after
     * initial region generation is complete. The algorithms will be run
     * in the order of the list.

         * Watershed Algorithm
         * 
         * Reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_%28algorithm%29
         * A good visualization:
         * http://artis.imag.fr/Publications/2003/HDS03/ (PDF)
         * 
         * Summary:
         * 
         * This algorithm utilizes the span.distanceToBorder() value, which
         * is generated by the generateDistanceField() operation.
         * 
         * Using the watershed analogy, the spans which are furthest from
         * a border (highest distance to border) represent the lowest points
         * in the watershed. A border span represents the highest possible
         * water level.
         * 
         * The main loop iterates, starting at the lowest point in the
         * watershed, then incrementing with each loop until the highest
         * allowed water level is reached.  This slowly "floods" the spans
         * starting at the lowest points.
         * 
         * (Remember: From this algorithm's point of view "lower" refers
         * to distance from a border, not height within the heightfield.)
         * 
         * During each iteration of the loop, spans that are below the
         * current water level are located and an attempt is made to either
         * add them to exiting regions or create new regions from them.
         * 
         * During the region expansion phase, if a newly flooded span
         * borders on an existing region, it is usually added to the region.
         * 
         * Any newly flooded span that survives the region expansion phase
         * is used as a seed for a new region.
         * 
         * At the end of the main loop, a final region expansion is
         * performed which should catch any stray spans that escaped region
         * assignment during the main loop.
