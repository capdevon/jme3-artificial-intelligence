/**
 * Implements three algorithms that clean up issues that can
 * develop around null region boarders.
 * 
 * <p><strong>Detect and fix encompassed null regions:</strong></p>
 * <p>If a null region is found that is fully encompassed by a single
 * region, then the region will be split into two regions at the
 * null region border.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Detect and fix "short wrapping" of null regions:</strong></p>
 * <p>Regions can sometimes wrap slightly around the corner of a null region
 * in a manner that eventually results in the formation of self-intersecting
 * polygons.</p>
 * <p>Example: Before the algorithm is applied:</p>
 * <p><a href=
 * "http://www.critterai.org/projects/nmgen/images/ohfg_08_cornerwrapbefore.png"

 * </a></p>
 * <p>Example: After the algorithm is applied:</p>

 * </a></p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Detect and fix incomplete null region connections:</strong></p>
 * <p>If a region touches null region only diagonally, then contour detection
 * algorithms may not properly detect the null region connection.  This can
 * adversely effect other algorithms in the pipeline.<p>
 * <p>Example: Before algorithm is applied:</p>
 * <p><pre>
 *     b b a a a a
 *     b b a a a a
 *     a a x x x x
 *     a a x x x x
 * </pre></p>
 * <p>Example: After algorithm is applied:</p>
 * <p><pre>
 *     b b a a a a
 *     b b b a a a <-- Span transferred to region B.
 *     a a x x x x
 *     a a x x x x
 * </pre></p>

     * Design Notes:
     * 
     * Three algorithms have been aggregated into this single class
     * for performance reasons.  Otherwise we would be stuck
     * performing three full contour searches rather than one.
     * 
     * The optimization method used in the search can result in missed
     * null region contours.  Consider the following pattern:
     * 
     *     x x x x x x
     *     x a a a a x   x - null region WITHOUT SPANS
     *     x a v v a x   a - region A
     *     x a v v a x   v - null region WITHOUT SPANS
     *     x a a a a x
     *     x x x x x x
     * 
     * If an all span search is performed, the outer null region (x) will
     * be detected, but during the process all a-region spans will be marked as
     * viewed. This will leave no spans available to detect the inner null
     * region (v).
     * 
     * I've not fixing this until it proves to be a problem or I figure out
     * a way of resolving the design issue without killing performance.

     * null regions border non-null regions.)  There are two options for
     * detection:  Search every single span looking for null region
     * neighbors.  Or search only null region spans looking for
     * non-null region neighbors. Since null region spans are only a tiny
     * fraction of total spans, the second option has better performance.</p>

     * at least one null region span in each contour, then set
     * useOnlyNullRegionSpans to TRUE.</p>
     * @param useOnlyNullRegionSpans If TRUE, then only null region spans
     * will be used to initially detect null region borders.  This
     * improves performance.  If FALSE, all spans are searched to detect
     * borders.
