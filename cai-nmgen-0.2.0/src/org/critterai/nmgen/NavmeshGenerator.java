    /**
     * Constructor
     * @param cellSize The width and depth resolution used when sampling
     * the source mesh.
     * <p>Constraints:  > 0</p>
     * 
     * @param cellHeight The height resolution used when sampling the
     * source mesh.
     * <p>Constraints:  > 0</p>
     * 
     * @param minTraversableHeight Represents the minimum floor to ceiling
     * height that will still allow the floor area to be considered walkable.
     * <p>Permits detection of overhangs in the geometry which make the
     * geometry below become unwalkable.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  > 0</p>
     * 
     * @param maxTraversableStep Represents the maximum ledge height that
     * is considered to still be walkable.
     * <p>Prevents minor deviations in height from improperly showing
     * as obstructions. Permits detection of stair-like structures, curbs, etc.
     * </p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param maxTraversableSlope The maximum slope that is considered
     * walkable. (Degrees)
     * <p>Constraints:  0 <= value <= 85</p>
     * 
     * @param clipLedges Indicates whether ledges should be marked
     * as unwalkable.
     * <p>A ledge is a normally walkable voxel that has one or more
     * accessible neighbors with a  an un-steppable drop from voxel top to
     * voxel top.</p>
     * <p>E.g. If an agent using the navmesh were to travel down from the
     * ledge voxel to its neighbor voxel, it would  result in the maximum
     * traversable step distance being violated.  The agent cannot legally
     * "step down" from a ledge to its neighbor.</p>
     * 
     * @param traversableAreaBorderSize Represents the closest any part of
     * the navmesh can get to an obstruction in the source mesh.
     * <p>Usually set to the maximum bounding radius of entities utilizing
     * the navmesh for navigation decisions.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param smoothingThreshold The amount of smoothing to be performed
     * when generating the distance field.
     * <p>This value impacts region formation and border detection.  A
     * higher value results in generally larger regions and larger border
     * sizes.  A value of zero will disable smoothing.</p>
     * <p>Constraints: 0 <= value <= 4</p>
     * 
     * @param useConservativeExpansion Applies extra algorithms to regions
     * to help prevent poorly formed regions from forming.
     * <p>If the navigation mesh is missing sections that should be present,
     * then enabling this feature will likely fix the problem</p>
     * <p>Enabling this feature significantly increased processing cost.</p>
     * 
     * @param minUnconnectedRegionSize The minimum region size for
     * unconnected (island) regions. (Voxels)
     * <p>Any generated regions that are not connected to any other region
     * and are smaller than this size will be culled before final navmesh
     * generation.  I.e. No longer considered walkable.<p>
     * <p>Constraints:  > 0</p>
     * 
     * @param mergeRegionSize Any regions smaller than this size will, if
     * possible, be merged with larger regions. (Voxels)
     * <p>Helps reduce the number of unnecessarily small regions that can
     * be formed.  This is especially an issue in diagonal path regions
     * where inherent faults in the region generation algorithm can result in
     * unnecessarily small regions.</p>
     * <p>If a region cannot be legally merged with a neighbor region, then
     * it will be left alone.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param maxEdgeLength The maximum length of polygon edges that
     * represent the border of the navmesh.
     * <p>More vertices will be added to navmesh border edges if this value
     * is exceeded for a particular edge. In certain cases this will reduce
     * the number of thin, long triangles in the navmesh.</p>
     * <p>A value of zero will disable this feature.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param edgeMaxDeviation The maximum distance the edge of the navmesh
     *  may deviate from the source geometry.
     * <p>Setting this lower will result in the navmesh edges following the
     * geometry contour more accurately at the expense of an increased
     * triangle count.</p>
     * <p>Setting the value to zero is not recommended since it can result
     * in a large increase in the number of
     * triangles in the final navmesh at a high processing cost.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param maxVertsPerPoly The maximum number of vertices per polygon
     * for polygons generated during the voxel to polygon conversion stage.
     * <p>Higher values reduce performance, but can also result in better
     * formed triangles in the navmesh.  A value of around 6 is generally
     * adequate with diminishing returns for values higher than 6.</p>
     * <p>Contraints: >= 3</p>
     * 
     * @param contourSampleDistance Sets the sampling distance to use when
     * matching the navmesh to the surface of the original geometry.
     * <p>Impacts how well the final mesh conforms to the original
     * geometry's surface contour. Higher values result in a navmesh which
     * conforms more closely to the original geometry's surface at the cost
     * of a higher final  triangle count and higher processing cost.</p>
     * <p>Setting this argument to zero will disable this functionality.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @param contourMaxDeviation The maximum distance the surface of the
     * navmesh may deviate from the surface of the original geometry.
     * <p>The accuracy of the algorithm which uses this value is impacted
     * by the value of the contour sample distance argument.</p>
     * <p>The value of this argument has no meaning if the contour sample
     * distance argument is set to zero.</p>
     * <p>Setting the value to zero is not recommended since it can result
     * in a large increase in the number of triangles in the final navmesh
     * at a high processing cost.</p>
     * <p>Constraints:  >= 0</p>
     * 
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException  If there are any unresolvable
     * argument errors.  (Most argument errors are avoided through value
     * clamping and other auto-correction methods.)
