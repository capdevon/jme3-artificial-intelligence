/**
 * Defines an axis aligned bounding box containing a grid based field.
 * <p>There are no enforced usage models for this class.  But within this
 * package the following standards apply:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The base (width/depth) of the field is defined by a grid of cells
 * with a size of {@link #cellSize()}.</li>
 * <li>Width of the field is associated with the x-axis and depth with
 * the z-axis.  So the width and depth of the field lies on the xz-plane.</p>
 * <li>The position of a cell is defined by an aggregate width/depth index
 * obtained from  {@link #gridIndex(int, int) gridIndex()}.</li>
 * <li>The grid indices originate at the minimum bounds of the field.</li>
 * <li>The height increment within each grid location is defined by the
 * value of {@link #cellHeight()}
 * and also originates at the field's minimum bounds.</li>
 * <li>Sizing of the bounds and the values of cell size/height will be
 * such that the bounds will not contain partial cells.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Warning: Behavior is undefined if the minimum bounds is set to be
 * greater than the maximum bounds.</p>
